Inspiration

I enjoy playing music or being a part of it. However, there are some people who might not be able to participate in such activity. So it would be better if at least they could be a part of music by using their face motion instead.

What it does

The program plays a note according to the position of a face. The user can also transpose the key (change to a higher or lower pitch set) and change a duration of a note.

How I built it

with Googling, tweaking, adding more lines, and using some idea, I managed to use OpenCV with Java in Eclipse.

Challenges I ran into

Sometimes, I could not detect problems so I spent a lot of time debugging and googling how to use this or use that.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

-The ability to abstract something completely new and apply it into a work with a certain level of understanding.

What I learned

-Learn what openCV is and how to use it.
-Learn how to use SceneBuilder and JFX.

What's next for Key-Motion

-Could be applied by using Microsoft Azure (which I forgot to use...)
-Make the code cleaner
-Improve GUI
-Improve sound quality
-Improve stability
